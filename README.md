I have created this repo for scripts which I need for my Oracle images.
these scripts are for OEL6.9 and Oracle/GRID 11.2.0.4

pre.sh            : creates env required , pre-requisites
createusers.sh    : creates oracle users
prepu01u02.sh     : creates dirs and mounts for grid and oracle folders
prepASMdisks.sh   : create ASMlib devices for Oracle GRID use.

these are files which are copied into system files
addtoprofile
grid_user_bash_profile
oracle_user_bash_profile
securityadd
sysctl.conf
